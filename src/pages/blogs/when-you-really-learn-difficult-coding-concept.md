<p class="first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-[#ADD8E6]">We usually list a bunch of skills which we don’t have on our resumees. For good reason: companies list absurd amounts of skills that we do not have altogether. That does not matter. What matters is to know enough about the core skills that get you through.
It’s not easy to determine whether you know something or not, especially in programming. The ultimate test of knowing something is to build something real.</p>

If you want to know whether you are ready to build a website with React, build one with React, but not one with your own features, rather a real one that is requested from you. If you could implement all the features of a client’s website, then you know the technology. 
But how do you know that you understand a concept? Say for example caching. Full disclosure, I still do not have a deep understanding of how caching works and what are the different types of caching and why they are different. Basically, it’s not as easy as we think. 
To have a deep understanding of a concept, here we are talking about core and difficult concepts of programming, there are steps to help you. You never learn just by reading or coding an example of a given concept. Say to understand caching, the steps could be like this:
## Read
First, read the definition, or rather different definitions of the concept. It’s proven to be wasteful in coding, so you have to read a more practical definition with examples. Now you have an idea about caching. 
## Implement
Now that you have an idea, try to implement it. It does not matter to pick up an example from someone else. At this stage, what matters is to be able to copy an implementation of the concept so you can recognize it better in the future. 
## Use
Try to practice, different days and times, use it in a project somewhere,  until you think you have a good grasp of the concept in your mind. Spoiler alert: You don’t. 
## Ultimate Test
When you use caching in a sample project, you have not yet mastered the concept. The only time you really know it is when you have to use it, focusing on "have to". When there is a real project in front of you, and you recognize that there is a need to cache or memoize something. At this stage, you should at least recognize the need for the usage of the concept. Suddenly, you realize that you actually do not know the concept well. You have to review, ask questions, and try to implement it in the real project. Once you implement it, you know the concept better than just about anyone.
Congratulations, now repeat that for the rest of your life on a monthly basis, as there are always new and difficult things in programming.
