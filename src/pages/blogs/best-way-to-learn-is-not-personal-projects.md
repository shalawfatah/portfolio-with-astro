Personal projects are the second best way to learn, not the first. The best way to learn is to find real projects, whether small and big, and finish them. 
Real projects have many aspects that make them much better than personal projects. Here is why I believe they are better for learning: 

## Reflection Of What People Want
You might want to build a social media on your own, but when you work somewhere, you hardly have a chance to work on a social media app. Instead, you work on projects that are from clients, business websites, apps, and may be some smaller scale projects that you have to take care of. In the end, the knowledge to build a social media app might help you code better, but the best way is to find what you'll be working on most of the time. 

## No Cutting Of Corners
When working on personal projects, you have a lot of freedom to cut corners, decrease or increase features and so on. You do not have that opportunity on client projects, often the smallest thing will take weeks to solve, but you have to solve it. This makes real-world projects a much better reflection of reality. 

## Ignoring Important Parts
The most important steps of any project happen before and after coding. Netlify is not the choice for every company, neither NextJS. You might have to deal with creating server and buckets on Digital Ocean, or AWS. You have to check Trello, Bitbucket, and many other services.

      It's very important not think of development and programming as pure coding, you are a professional first. You need to communicate, reach targets, etc.

It's important to know that many companies have already established their tech-stack before you ever go, and they expect you to follow their way of doing things. 
It's best if you borrow projects from companies to do, that will help you to learn much faster, as you have to deal with all the important parts of a project.

## Best Conventions
You can't just any library, plugin or code snippet in the real world, you have to know if it's maintained or not. However, you can use just about anything in your personal projects. For real-world projects, they will ask you about performance, accessibility, and many other aspects of your app. At some point, you have to deal with images and how to offer them, or push them to a certain cloud. 
You might have to deal with videos, and load them as fast as possible. This is all dealt with in your personal projects, you can always optimize images and videos, but you can't do that on real projects. You have to find a way around them.

## Professional, Not Developer
On personal projects, you can ignore them for months, and returning to them when you want. On real-world projects, you have a timeline to reach and your progress matters. Half of your work as a developer is how much you can perform, not how smart you can code. 
It's very important not to take development job as pure coding. There are many other parts like communication, performance, cooperation, etc. You can only experience these things when you work on real-world projects. You are first a professional not a developer. 

## Review, Growth
You can't always see what you are good at, others with experience should watch and monitor your growth. Often they give you good advice on how to progress in your career, or might turn to other relevant careers like DevRel, or others.

It's good to know that while doing real-world projects, you have a good opportunity to grow and find your way, which is impossible in personal projects. 

## Conclusion, Find Real Projects
Send an email to your local companies, ask them if there is a project that you can work with them for free, under the condition that you can present it in your portfolio. This not only give you a good chance on working on real projects, but also gives you a huge headway in communication and a much better chance of employment. 
They know you are a beginner, you don't have to prove anything. Instead of creating a social media on Youtube, create a business website which will be online for a long time, that will you have to grow as a developer and a professional.
