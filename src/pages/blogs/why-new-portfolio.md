I think this might be my fifth protfolio.I made one with GatsbyJS, then one with React, then one with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, then one with Wordpress. <br>
You'd think it will be the other way around. However, I was trying to get hired full time and could not find a good job, and I could not. Most jobs wanted specific portfolios, so I tried to have portoflios for each job that I want. It was not a good experience.<br>
However, it gave me some good experience with different tech-stacks. Things look easy in theory. Wordpress is just a CMS, until you try to make something for a client, then you'll know why it's a career. 
This one is different. I'm not looking for a job. A minor reason is I wanted to try this new framework called **Astro**. It's important for me to try new things, so I'll know first hand its potential. <br>
However, the main reason I built a new portfolio was after some experience in development, I realized the value of **minimalism**. It's very important to give what people want without tiring them with UI/UX tricks. People do not need your hover tricks, they really just want to see what you are about. If you can make it interesting and simple at the same time, that's what every developer should strive for. <br>
It's like when you are younger, you believe in **performative** side of things too much, but after a while, you understand the value of stability, and predictability. You value **authentic presentation** of people and things around you. You might also value *subtle but creative touches*. Things that will make a product's design to be **long-lasting**, not flashy but short-lived.
I believe this portoflio might be long-lasting. Of course, I will make some changes here and there, but over-all, I think this is a good representation of me and my work.<br>
Simplicity is an art. Using big words, unless necessary (like doctors), could be a sign of inability to explain myself. This is the same for technology. The request is simple enough for a client, the response should match it. The software design should also aspire to be that simple but important and interesting at the same time. <br>
I believe minimalism is a time-proof approach for designing anything, including managing one's life. I designed this new portfolio to reflect on this new approach that I take for things: The *minimum viable solution to complex problems*. Let's leave the complexity to the professionals when they try to think through the process, **the presentation should always be simple**.
