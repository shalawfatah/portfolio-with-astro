In any case, try to code for two to three years. That will help you understand the ins and outs of software. However, know that you are not meant to be just a programmer. If for some reason you felt like you are on a wrong track, there are multiple jobs awaiting you. In fact, you have a great niche as not many programmers give up coding, while some non-coding jobs need programming.

Here I will list some of these jobs and what is required of you if you join such a job, along with how much coding do you need to be good at them.

## Product/Project/Operation Manager
These jobs requires no programming. However, if the product or project that you manage is a website or an app, or any type of software, coding experience is highly valued, and often required. The more you know about coding, the better valued you are in this job.
You can either apply for this job or you can tell your company that you are interested in filling such a position when available.

## Technical Writing & Documentation
When a software company becomes large enough to have a dozen developers, they will need a technical writer. This is still a software job. Often, this job might require lots of expeirence coding, but in most cases, you can apply with a limited expeirence. 
This job also needs some communication skills. If you think you can manage communication, writing and explainig, this could be a perfect fit for you.

## Business Analyst
Another job which requires understanding the basics of software and communication. As a developer, you don't have to deal with clients. As a business analyst, you have to take the input of the clients, and inform software developers about the request in technical terms.
This job looks easy, but in fact it's very difficult. Often clients have something on mind that they do not know how to translate, and you have to decode that. If the concept fails, it's on you.

## Technical Recruiter
Imagine finding developers for other companies while you do not know what coding is. You won't get that far. If you are a technical recruiter, you need a basic understanding of how software works. This way, your job will be much easier and your clients will appreciate you. 

## Software Quality Tester
You will inspect all aspects of the software for functionality and performance. This job requires some coding expeirence in order to know what you are looking for when you do your job. However, it does not require you to write code by yourself. 

## Software Sales Representative
This is a fairly communication-based job. However, imagine if your client knows something about coding and asks you a question about the technical aspects of your software. Thus, the job requires a good understanding of code and software. 

## DevRel, Dev Advocate
When companies provide software as a service, they often need a developer to advocate and build relationships with other developers. You will mainly work on social networking apps and events. 
This job does not require coding, but understanding the code is highly valuable and often companies need lots of coding experience to hire someone to be a developer relations. 

## Consultant & R&D
If you are a rock-star developer who wants to do something else. Being a consultant is a pretty easy way to make it. Companies and start-ups need an experienced person to consult them about the design and architecture of their software operations. 
R&D in tech is also another job where instead of coding, you do research into the impact and potential of the software.

There are dozens of such jobs available for those who know how to code. Some of these jobs can be very satisfying. The great thing about coding is the flexibility that it gives you to pick a job that you like.
You can even join one of these jobs for a year, if you feel like you need a gap year to relax and detox from screen. Once you've proved that you can code, companies love versatile people who can do many things. No one will ask you why you left your coding job for a consultancy or advocacy, they will appreciate that you can do more than one job. 
As a developer, after some years of experience, it's best if you nurture the mindset that you can do the job that you like, and that can be any of the dozens of jobs that are available, some of which do not require coding.
