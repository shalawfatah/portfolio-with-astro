## The Problem
It's not easy to be a developer. What is considered once-in-a-year problem for other jobs, is the daily routine for you. You have problems where you can't find help anywhere, and you have to solve them. You have to design systems that you've seen no one else do. At some point, it takes a toll, and you might turn very gloomy and disappointed. 

## The Solution
People have different life styles and surroundings. This issue has been discussed many times in my circle, and people come up with different solutions. What works for me is to create a daily routine where I have several active habits.

## The Blueprint
I have six routines I have to do daily which I'll list them below. For each of these, I have two alternatives to do, for example, if I did not feel like exercising today, I'll run, if could not, I will swim. The same is true for all other habits. I have to do at least four of these every day, but I missed one day, I will not compensate. 
Here's the table of the entire daily habits I nurture:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Routine</th>
    <th>Alternative</th>
    <th>Second Alternative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exercise  <span class="note">watch & follow the video</span></td>
    <td>Run  </td>
    <td>Swim  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning<span class="note">New concept in coding</span></td>
    <td>Reading<span class="note">Read a blog about tech</span></td>
    <td>Practice<span class="note">Practice something you've learnt</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Teaching<span class="note">Teach someone coding</span></td>
    <td>Writing<span class="note">Write for tech blog</span></td>
    <td>Side-project<span class="note">Develop your side project</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reading<span class="note">A book, preferably fiction</span></td>
    <td>Meditation</td>
    <td>Hobby<span class="note">Something like drawing</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Organization<span class="note">Cleaning, washing</span></td>
    <td>Journal</td>
    <td>Skill<span class="note">Make a small thing</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Skill<span class="note">Drawing, music, martial arts</span></td>
    <td>Socialization</td>
    <td>Small Risk</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## The Rationale
By no means this can be copied. People's habits and daily routines are different. You can use this to create your own daily habits. The good thing is, your day should not start and end watching a screen. You have to spread these activities throughout your day. This way, you have something that you enjoy and get your mind off of the computer. 

## Added Advantage
This helps you to be more in shape, more informed, and with lots of skills. After sometime, you'll re-write your skills where you do exercise for 20 minutes a day, and skill (drawing, music) for 20 minutes a day. You enjoy learning more, and reading more. Your habits will make you a completely different person. Suddenly, from a developer which is bored with coding every day, you have many things you take care of, including socialization and networking. 

## Additional Note
If you jail your digital devices after 11 PM or anytime you want to sleep in an hour, this gives you a robust way to go through the day productive and energetic. This will help in reducing anxiety and stress, and just makes you a better programmer and person.
