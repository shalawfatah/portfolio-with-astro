<p class="first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-[#FA8072]">Being a web developer for some time. I've tried multiple frameworks to build websites and web apps. I also tried React Native to build hybrid smartphone apps. The only geneuine hybrid system that I see as a the future of development is Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
I'll list why I see this tech as the future of only web, but smartphone, TV, and all other devices. </p>

## PWA is full-featured
Almost anything you can do with your native smartphone app, you can do with your PWA. There are still a couple of features that are not supported on iOS, but they have already been listed to be supported in the future. All features that you see native to smartphone apps, will soon be supported for PWA, even for other devices.
In terms of performance, sooner or later, web apps will be as fast if not faster as native mobile apps.

## PWA makes developers powerful
Up to this moment, it's difficult for developers to build anything other than their specialty. If you are a web developer, you can really only be a good web developer, same is true for app developers. This extends to android, ios, and other fields. Basically, there are thousands of fields and you have to pick one.

      If we build an open source shop for PWAs, with the guarantee that it will not be abused to get money from people and businesses, it will soon be larger than both those two platforms

PWA combines some of these fields. You can be a web developer, iOS developer, and Android developer at the same time. This is huge for developers as they can find jobs easier. 

## PWA makes business less expensive
If your business is need of a website, web app, and an Andriod and iOS app, then you need at least 10 developers. It's not easy to circumvent that fact. However, with PWA, you can hire one or two, which slashes the cost of employment. 

## PWA can be extended
PWA can be extended into other devices, like TV, smart watches, tablets, etc. The technology is very promising in the way that uses Web APIs to curcumvent the complexities of the current systems. So long the web and browser work on your system, PWA can find a way to be extended. 

## Avoid corporate capture
With PWA, you do not need App Store, or Google Play conditions. You can avoid all that by hosting it on your website. In fact, if we could all create an open source shop for PWAs, with the guarantee that it will not be abused to get money from people and businesses, it will soon be larger than both those two platforms. 

## PWA is becoming popular
Developers pushed Apple to support Web Push Notifications for two years, until Apple announced its support for Desktop this year (2022) and for mobile, next year (2023). This makes PWA to support all major features available for native apps. 
PWA has already been used by major companies like Twitter, Uber, Alibaba, AliExpress, Forbes and many more. It's getting noticed in all manners and will be used even more. 
The future seems to be for PWAs as with the least amount of effort, you can offer an enormous services in the form of a platform-agnostic app.
