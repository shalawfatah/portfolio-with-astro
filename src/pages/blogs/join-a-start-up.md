When comfortable enough with coding, instead of being lost in a big company with very limited tasks, join a start-up where you are expected to grow and do real tasks.
## Growth in Skills not CV
It's important to know that big companies do not need you for important tasks. They need you to do every day routine of creating this and that component, testing them, and so on. Your job will be repetitive. It's the opposite in start-ups. Often you have to do everything by yourself. You are a backend, frontend, devops, and the architect. 
This is too much, but this is the only way you grow as a programmer. You are never ready to be everything until you test these waters. While a start-up is not much like a big company in terms of CV, it's too much in terms of experience.
## Confidence not Recognition
When you are in a start-up, you have a great opportunity to build your skills and confidence at the same time. In a big company, the structure does not allow much. In a start-up, you have a dynamic position where you can move, while no matter what you do, often in a big company you have a static position. 
This leads to more confidence in smaller companies rather than big ones.
## Office Politics
There is a lot at stake in bigger companies and often petty office politics could prevent you from getting noticed. Once your superior did not like you, it's hard to operate. In smaller companies, small teams make it possible to have a better culture. 
Often these companies are very careful about who joins these teams, to avoid mismatches and trouble.
## Better Work-Life Balance
While small start-ups require lots of tasks in different tech-stacks, there is a better work-life balance where you can get your mind off work once you are not working. In bigger companies, you are first an employee of that company then yourself, while the equation is the other way around in smaller companies, you are yourself who has a job in this start-up. 
This distinction is very important. Do not let your job or company to define and brand you, let it be a part of your life, no more no less.
## Don't Start as an Engineer
When trying to join a FAANG, the coding interview will be in algorithms and data structures. While it's not mind-boggling and can be passed, it's hardly a reflection on one's skills. 
Can we really determine where and when we need such algorithms when we pass these interviews? Often not. It's better to start from the beginning, where you have a lots of tasks and often you need one of those algorithms, then you will understand things in a better context. After some experience, you'll have a much better mastery of coding, not only theory and memorization.
There are many more reasons to join a start-up rather than a big company, but the biggest one for me is that start-ups have a better environment for junior programmers. Of course, there are many benefits for famous companies, but unless you are totally sure, it might not be the dream that you are looking for, especially when you are just starting.
