It's not the talent to program. The ability to code is often overshadowed by some other skills that developers need:
## 1. Communication Problem:
This one is vital. I know this has been my major problem. I have no problem spending weeks on an issue. However, I get lost in the details of the issue. When asked, I have a hard time answering what has been done about the issue. I know it's very difficult because if it was the other way around, that is if I was on the managerial position, I wouldn't like such a developer.
## Solution
The last 20 minutes of every day of work, write what have you done. What is the problem and simplify the issues. This will not only help you explain the process to your coworkers, but actually helps you find a solution easier. We need to be able to explain a problem in simple words to know the solution is right there and we just had to complicate it.
## 2. Networking Problem
Where I come from, nepotism was a huge issue. You wouldn't get far if you did not know someone somewhere. Where I live now, Canada, it's very similar. The difference is you wouldn't get far if you are not skilled even though you know someone. 
Networking is huge in any profession, but it's especially important for developers. The world is digital and it's made like that by you. You have to know ways to socialize with people online. **More than 80% of jobs in Canada are based on networking**, that is you know someone somewhere. The number is too big to bet. 
## Solution:
Get into LinkedIn, Slack or Discord, and try to speak with one person a day. Remember, it might not be enough, so try to speak to three people. One of them would be interested. These relationships will help you not just as a developer, but as a person as well. You never know how helpful people can be for your health.
## 3. Professionalism Problem
If you can't maintain the appearance of normalcy due to the pressure of work, that's okay. It happens to programmers. Often we face issues that have not been solved by anyone before us, or at least it was not reported, and that's a hell of a routine to commit to. You might not have time for your coworkers. 
## Solution:
Make a routine of professional check-ups with your coworkers. Make it casual and routine like so it would be taken as a professional courtesy. It's important for your coworkers to know that you have their back when they need you. However, often people are just as busy and anxious as you, so if you did not get a good response, just overlook it. Try to know your coworkers, so you'd have a better way of communicating with them. 
## 4. Inititive Problem
It's good enough if you are a professional developer who communicates clearly and helps his/her coworkers, but something remains: You are expected to take initiative. You see, every coworker likes someone who is serious about his/her job in a non-intrusive way. 
## Solution:
Initiatives can be small things, like explaining your work issues in detail in a group meeting, or giving a visual report about things that have been perfomred well in the last month, or even the plagues that the team suffer from, the bugs that seeken us. 
Tracking issues and achivements is important because it leads to a good dsicussion between team mates and often people come up with good solutions that you don't expect, or show support that you need. 
Initiative is not only verbal, you can do anything that helps, but this also should be something that stays in the boundaries of your work. 
## 4. You, the Problem
You have to know yourself. Everyone in the workplace have certain sides that the others do not like. No matter how much appreciated you are, you do have certain things others do not like. The biggest problem about this issue is that often we love ourselves enough that we overlook our negative aspects. We can't see them at all. 
## Solution:
As you do check-ups on your coworkers, try to do it on your own too. Ask your friends if you have something that they like you to change, and be chill, almost everyone has. This leads to a better environment where you know yourself (at least related to others) better, and you can work on your self-improvement. Remember, some traits you can change and improve, others you can mute in the workplace. Write them down in sticky notes so you can remember every day, it will help you remember, and be humble with your work environment.
If you can harness these four skills, the ability to code will improve after a while, and you will the rock-star developer that everyone wants, just don't sell yourself cheap.
