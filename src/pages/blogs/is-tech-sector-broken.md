Some years ago, I came to Canada. I could not resume my career as a journalist, so I started coding.<br>
I learnt on my own, no school, no bootcamps. I did not have enough time, or even resources to take part in any lengthy training courses. It took me longer to enter the tech-sector. Youtube influencers would say a range of three months to one year, but for me, it was difficult to get a job even after a year.<br>
Then I decided to build websites for people on my own. While applying for jobs, I was building websites with Wordpress and Shopify for people. This gave me a good experience as training is never enough. **Months of training does not amount to one real job**. <br>

My biggest concern back then was: <i>Am I ready?</i> To be honest, after years of being in this sector, I still ask the same question. This question may never leave you. So if you have that question, try to do some real world projects on your own, that's the best learning method and confirmation. <br>
It's never clear whether you are ready to do something or not in this field. Either you have too much experience and the app is basically a replica of what you've already built, or the project will have some hurdles.<br>
The next biggest challenge was <b>coding interviews</b>. The first thing that every company shoud realize is that people <i>should be tested in their own fields</i>. Say I've trained to be a React Developer, for an entry job, you can't test me on <i>Algorithms and Data Structures</i>. I have to first build something with the tech-stack, then learn that I need those things. Being a frontend developer does not mean I have to start with being able to recreate the entire JS data structures and algorithms. <br>
The coding interviews often lead people to <i>memorize</i> things without any benefit. People will memorize how to conduct <i>sliding window pattern</i> without a proper <i>API handling</i>. What's the use of complex algorithmic patterns if you do not know where and when to use them? <br>

  <div class="mb-2">
    <div class="h-3 text-6xl text-left text-white">“</div>
    <p class="px-4 text-2xl text-center text-white">
      Companies should realize that we are not engineers, we are developers. We use the tools that engineers have built for us.

The thing is, only an experienced person on top of their game can fully comprehend what data structure is necessary for a specific task and when to use the most-optimized algorithimic pattern to solve certain issues, along with analyzing the performance of any function through Big O Notation: <b>Senior Developer</b>. <br>
Companies should realize that we are not engineers, we are developers. We use the tools that engineers have built for us. We may become engineers one day, but that day should always come after experience in development. <br>
I believe tech-sector should change its course. The fact is, developers nowadays are not just math-saavy or logic-geniuses, they are oridnary people, some with media background, like me. And yes, we are very necessary to get the job done. <br>
While we might not have the highest analytical talent, we have a keen eye for shortcomings, and tech-sector have this shortcoming of being the Harvard and Cambridge of jobs, while the compensation is pretty much like any other job. Either way, <b>the sector has to moderate its expectations</b>, a junior cannot and should not be able to ship the entire web app, why should he/she know all these things that only someone who's responsible for everything should know? <br>
The issue is very clear for me. Tech jobs used to be few and far between. Only a very serious application of software would be built, now everyone needs a website, web app, smartphone app, etc.
